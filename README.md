### 1. Introduction 

This exercise served as introduction to connecting and using the Twitter API. 

### 2. Preprocessing

In this exercise, we worked on preprocessing text data following the next steps: 
1. Import and examine data
2. Remove initial text metadata
3. Remove numbers, punctuation, tabs, and convert to lower case with Gensim
4. Remove stop words and short words
5. Stemming and Lematization

### 3. Text Representation (Part 1)

In this exercise, we learned to represent text data numerically by applying the next methods: 
1. Absolute frequencies
2. Relative frequencies
3. TF-IDF frequencies
4. N-grams

### 4. Text Representation (Part 2)

In this exercise, we learned more advanced ways to represent text data numerically by applying the next models: 
1. Word2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. BERT

### 5. Text Classification

In this exercise, we learned to build different models for text classification by applying the next steps:
